This VM type is meant to compete directly with AWS' T2 instances. In the below few words (or more ðŸ˜„ ) I try to explain what this means and why you should care. If you still have questions after reading, hit me up on Twitter or leave a comment below.
So why do I need a burstable size anyway? If you have applications that remain idle for a long time and burst occasionally, then the B-series might be the perfect fit for you.</description></item></channel></rss>
