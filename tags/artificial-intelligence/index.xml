      <description>Azure Video Indexer is one of my favorite services! It provides some amazing features such as:
 Identify faces and celebrities Extract text and objects (e.g. cat, table, car etc.) Detect scenes and shots Emotion and sentiment detection Audio effects such as clapping, silence &amp;amp; speech  The full list of features can be viewed at https://vi.microsoft.com/en-us/
Get the credits rolling! Recently, Video Indexer announced they’ve added the capability to detect rolling credits in the videos.</description>
