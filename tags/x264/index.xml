      <description>Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s not often you see so many logos of tech giants on one page backing the same technology. In my experience, every enterprise has developed a case of NIH and come up with their standards. No surprise then that there&amp;rsquo;s an XKCD describing this phenomenon!
But when the AV1 1.0.0 spec was finalized in 2018, with the backing of so many giants, the world knew AV1 would be a serious piece of tech.</description>

      <description>This is a 3-part blog covering how to build a scalable shot-based serverless video encoder in Azure. In Part 1, I explain what AV1 is and where we are in the video encoding space. In part 2, we create a logic app to upload and index the video. In part 3, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to split the video into its scenes and encode individual scenes. For reference, here are the links to all the parts:</description>

      <title>It&#39;s time to replace GIFs with AV1 video!</title>
      <link>https://singhkays.com/blog/its-time-replace-gifs-with-av1-video/</link>

      <description>It is 2019 and we need to make a decision about GIFs (no, not that one! We’re never going to be able to decide that one!). GIFs take up a massive amount of space (often multiple megabytes!) and if you’re a web developer, then that’s completely against your ethos! As a web developer, you want to minimize the bits your users need to download so that your website loads fast. That’s why you minify javascript, optimize PNGs, JPEGs and sometimes turn JPEGs to WebPs as well.</description>
