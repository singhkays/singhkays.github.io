      <description>AVIF in Spectrum lib While browsing for AV1/AVIF updates, I noticed this commit to Facebook&amp;rsquo;s open source Spectrum library that adds support for AVIF format.
 https://github.com/facebookincubator/spectrum/commit/89b87bee831d3c7aabd0ad327fb118ce699df55d  Spectrum is an image transcoding library for iOS and Android that is meant to be integrated into apps for image operations. Hopefully this means that we&amp;rsquo;ll see apps supporting AVIF format soon!

      <description>If May and June were F1 race cars in terms of speed of AV1 development, then July would probably be a Honda Civic. After numerous exciting announcements in the previous month, July felt like everyone&amp;rsquo;s on vacation, which is probably true because summer months tend to be slow as the school&amp;rsquo;s out. So, this update will be a short one as I&amp;rsquo;m out on vacation as well :)

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a pretty busy for me professionally which is why this month&amp;rsquo;s AV1 ecosystem update is coming in pretty late. It&amp;rsquo;s been one of the most exciting months for AV1 development and a lot to catch up on! With so much news this month, it is starting to feel like we&amp;rsquo;re at the cusp of something big! (which we hope AV1 will be )

      <description>May was another amazing month for the AV1 codec! We saw great progress in the SVT-AV1 encoder, Android update news and some surprising news out of China!
SVT-AV1 is making strides! Let&amp;rsquo;s start with SVT-AV1 encoder, the current encoder of choice for Netflix, being developed by the folks at Intel. In May, version 0.5.0 was released with the following features:
 8 bit / 10 bit 4:2:0 up to 4K60p resolutions Presets 0-8 New API, FFmpeg, GStreamer plugins Rate control support (VBR, CVBR) Block sizes from 4x4 to 128x128 Non-square blocks Tiles Deblocking / CDEF / Restoration filters Film Grain Warped motion estimation Intra block copy Trellis quantized coefficient optimization Support for 4 and 5 layers prediction structures Chroma search in MD Multi-reference picture support  Other notable updates   May also saw the most number of commits to the SVT-AV1 Github repo as shown by the graph below.</description>
