      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a pretty busy for me professionally which is why this month&amp;rsquo;s AV1 ecosystem update is coming in pretty late. It&amp;rsquo;s been one of the most exciting months for AV1 development and a lot to catch up on! With so much news this month, it is starting to feel like we&amp;rsquo;re at the cusp of something big! (which we hope AV1 will be )
Youtube pauses AV1 rollout Currently, YouTube is the biggest streaming platform delivering AV1 video and is responsible for the majority of AV1 video consumption on the internet.</description>
