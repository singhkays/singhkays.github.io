In addition to an OS disk, each VM also has a temporary disk that is present on the compute cluster hosting your VM.
Why is my OS disk not @ /dev/sda? In most cases the OS disk is /dev/sda but in some odd cases it is not. This is not an Azure specific issue but a default Linux behavior.</description></item><item><title>Detect Rolling Credits with Azure Video Indexer</title><link>https://singhkays.github.io/blog/detect-rolling-credits-video-indexer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://singhkays.github.io/blog/detect-rolling-credits-video-indexer/</guid><description>Azure Video Indexer is one of my favorite services!

It is easy to use applications like Kubernetes to automate the scale out your containerized applications based on workload demand. For applications running on VMs, we have cloud native services like VM Scale Sets that make scaling in and out a breeze. However, for an on-prem application going through a lift &amp;amp; shift to the cloud, vertical scaling of the VM is still the king.</description></item><item><title>Understanding the Azure B Series and CPU credits</title><link>https://singhkays.github.io/blog/understanding-azure-b-series/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2017 16:59:56 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://singhkays.github.io/blog/understanding-azure-b-series/</guid><description>Azure recently introduced its first burstable VM size - the B-series. This VM type is meant to compete directly with AWS' T2 instances. In the below few words (or more 😄 ) I try to explain what this means and why you should care. If you still have questions after reading, hit me up on Twitter or leave a comment below.
So why do I need a burstable size anyway? If you have applications that remain idle for a long time and burst occasionally, then the B-series might be the perfect fit for you.</description></item><item><title>Integrating Azure Automation Runbook Output with Logic Apps</title><link>https://singhkays.github.io/blog/azure-automation-runbook-output-logic-apps/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2017 10:28:40 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://singhkays.github.io/blog/azure-automation-runbook-output-logic-apps/</guid><description>Problem One of the challenges I have come across the last few days while working with Azure Automation &amp;amp; Logic Apps is how to integrate the output of the Automation Runbook in the Logic Apps workflow.

Clean and beautiful typography can make the experience of coding or reading an article so much better. It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder if you search for &amp;ldquo;best programming font&amp;rdquo;, there&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of font comparison articles. However, one of the things that is universally agreed upon is how terrible Courier/Courier New is.
