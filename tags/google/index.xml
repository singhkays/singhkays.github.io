Since the AV1 standard as formalized, the community has been waiting to see when SOC manufacturers add hardware support for AV1 decoding. It looks like we'll be waiting a lot longer for such a chip from Qualcomm. In what might come as a shock, MediaTek announced the first SOC to feature such support with their new Dimensity 1000 chip.</description></item><item><title>AV1 Ecosystem Update: October 2019</title><link>https://singhkays.com/blog/av1-ecosystem-update-october-2019/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://singhkays.com/blog/av1-ecosystem-update-october-2019/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start this month&amp;rsquo;s roundup with a faster decoder!
dav1d 0.5.0 &amp;amp; 0.5.1 release In October, dav1d saw two new releases with some fantastic speed improvements. Here is a summary:
Large improvements in speed on SSSE3 CPU (up to 40% speedup) Speed improvements on AVX-2 (for 4-7%) Speed improvements on ARM64 (up to 10%) and ARM32. 0.5.1 is a minor release which brings improvements in speed for SSE2 CPUs (up to 50% speedup), and ARMv7 CPUs (up to 41% speedup).</description></item><item><title>Now Available: Weekly build of libaom AV1 + FFmpeg docker image</title><link>https://singhkays.com/blog/docker-image-av1-ffmpeg-libaom/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://singhkays.com/blog/docker-image-av1-ffmpeg-libaom/</guid><description>Motivation While trying to try out the latest features for the libaom AV1 encoder, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to figure out how to get a hold of the latest binary. As of writing of this blog, I haven&amp;rsquo;t come across any source on the web that publishes a binary of libaom AV1 encoder. Often while trying to get a hold of the latest changes in libaom, you have to build the source yourself which takes time.</description></item><item><title>AV1 Ecosystem Update: August 2019</title><link>https://singhkays.com/blog/av1-ecosystem-update-august-2019/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://singhkays.com/blog/av1-ecosystem-update-august-2019/</guid><description>AVIF in Spectrum lib While browsing for AV1/AVIF updates, I noticed this commit to Facebook&amp;rsquo;s open source Spectrum library that adds support for AVIF format.
https://github.com/facebookincubator/spectrum/commit/89b87bee831d3c7aabd0ad327fb118ce699df55d Spectrum is an image transcoding library for iOS and Android that is meant to be integrated into apps for image operations. Hopefully this means that we&amp;rsquo;ll see apps supporting AVIF format soon!
FFmpeg 4.2 release FFmpeg 4.2 codenamed &amp;ldquo;Ada&amp;rdquo; was released on August 5th, 2019.</description></item><item><title>AV1 Ecosystem Update: July 2019</title><link>https://singhkays.com/blog/av1-ecosystem-update-july-2019/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://singhkays.com/blog/av1-ecosystem-update-july-2019/</guid><description>If May and June were F1 race cars in terms of speed of AV1 development, then July would probably be a Honda Civic. After numerous exciting announcements in the previous month, July felt like everyone&amp;rsquo;s on vacation, which is probably true because summer months tend to be slow as the school&amp;rsquo;s out. So, this update will be a short one as I&amp;rsquo;m out on vacation as well :)

It&amp;rsquo;s been one of the most exciting months for AV1 development and a lot to catch up on! With so much news this month, it is starting to feel like we&amp;rsquo;re at the cusp of something big! (which we hope AV1 will be )
Youtube pauses AV1 rollout Currently, YouTube is the biggest streaming platform delivering AV1 video and is responsible for the majority of AV1 video consumption on the internet.</description></item><item><title>AV1 Ecosystem Update: May 2019</title><link>https://singhkays.com/blog/av1-ecosystem-update-may-2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://singhkays.com/blog/av1-ecosystem-update-may-2019/</guid><description>May was another amazing month for the AV1 codec! We saw great progress in the SVT-AV1 encoder, Android update news and some surprising news out of China!
SVT-AV1 is making strides! Let&amp;rsquo;s start with SVT-AV1 encoder, the current encoder of choice for Netflix, being developed by the folks at Intel. In May, version 0.5.0 was released with the following features:
8 bit / 10 bit 4:2:0 up to 4K60p resolutions Presets 0-8 New API, FFmpeg, GStreamer plugins Rate control support (VBR, CVBR) Block sizes from 4x4 to 128x128 Non-square blocks Tiles Deblocking / CDEF / Restoration filters Film Grain Warped motion estimation Intra block copy Trellis quantized coefficient optimization Support for 4 and 5 layers prediction structures Chroma search in MD Multi-reference picture support Other notable updates May also saw the most number of commits to the SVT-AV1 Github repo as shown by the graph below.</description></item></channel></rss>
