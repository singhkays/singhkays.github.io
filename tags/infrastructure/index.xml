In addition to an OS disk, each VM also has a temporary disk that is present on the compute cluster hosting your VM.
Why is my OS disk not @ /dev/sda? In most cases the OS disk is /dev/sda but in some odd cases it is not. This is not an Azure specific issue but a default Linux behavior.</description></item><item><title>Microsoft Ignite 2018: VM Scale Sets + Shared Image Gallery = Infrastructure at scale - BRK3339</title><link>https://singhkays.com/blog/ignite2018-vm-scale-sets-shared-image-gallery-infrastructure/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://singhkays.com/blog/ignite2018-vm-scale-sets-shared-image-gallery-infrastructure/</guid><description>When you need to create a lot of instances from a custom VM image, VM Scale Sets and Shared Image Gallery are the services you need to use. In this session we walk through how to combine the power of VM Scale Sets &amp;amp; Shared Image Gallery to build infrastructure at scale.

It is easy to use applications like Kubernetes to automate the scale out your containerized applications based on workload demand. For applications running on VMs, we have cloud native services like VM Scale Sets that make scaling in and out a breeze. However, for an on-prem application going through a lift &amp;amp; shift to the cloud, vertical scaling of the VM is still the king.</description></item><item><title>Understanding the Azure B Series and CPU credits</title><link>https://singhkays.com/blog/understanding-azure-b-series/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2017 16:59:56 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://singhkays.com/blog/understanding-azure-b-series/</guid><description>Azure recently introduced its first burstable VM size - the B-series. This VM type is meant to compete directly with AWS' T2 instances. In the below few words (or more ðŸ˜„ ) I try to explain what this means and why you should care. If you still have questions after reading, hit me up on Twitter or leave a comment below.
So why do I need a burstable size anyway? If you have applications that remain idle for a long time and burst occasionally, then the B-series might be the perfect fit for you.</description></item></channel></rss>
