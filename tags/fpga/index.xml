      <description>If May and June were F1 race cars in terms of speed of AV1 development, then July would probably be a Honda Civic. After numerous exciting announcements in the previous month, July felt like everyone&amp;rsquo;s on vacation, which is probably true because summer months tend to be slow as the school&amp;rsquo;s out. So, this update will be a short one as I&amp;rsquo;m out on vacation as well :)
Mile High Video 2019 Nathan Egge of Mozilla and Brion Vibber of Wikimedia presented a session recapping AV1&amp;rsquo;s progress in the last year.</description>
