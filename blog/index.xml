This deal &amp;ndash; reportedly worth over $100 million &amp;ndash; is one of the most lucrative podcast deals. The presence of this deal, let alone the magnitude, is rare for the podcast ecosystem, which is built on open principles i.e. all podcasts are available everywhere. Therefore, the concept of exclusivity does not exist in the vocabulary of podcast listeners nor podcast creators.</description></item><item><title>AV1 Ecosystem Update: January 2020</title><link>https://singhkays.com/blog/av1-ecosystem-update-january-2020/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://singhkays.com/blog/av1-ecosystem-update-january-2020/</guid><description>January is usually a big month for tech because the Consumer Electronics Shows kicks off every year in Las Vegas.

In addition to an OS disk, each VM also has a temporary disk that is present on the compute cluster hosting your VM.
Why is my OS disk not @ /dev/sda? In most cases the OS disk is /dev/sda but in some odd cases it is not.

We’re never going to be able to decide that one!). GIFs take up a massive amount of space (often multiple megabytes!) and if you’re a web developer, then that’s completely against your ethos! As a web developer, you want to minimize the bits your users need to download so that your website loads fast. That’s why you minify javascript, optimize PNGs, JPEGs and sometimes turn JPEGs to WebPs as well.</description></item><item><title>Detect Rolling Credits with Azure Video Indexer</title><link>https://singhkays.com/blog/detect-rolling-credits-video-indexer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://singhkays.com/blog/detect-rolling-credits-video-indexer/</guid><description>Azure Video Indexer is one of my favorite services!

With every new generation of video encoders, more computational power has been required to achieve the compression benefits. HEVC/H.265 is the latest state of the art video compression standard with x265 being the most popular open-source encoder used for encoding into the HEVC/H.265 format. In comparison to AVC/H.264 (the previous state of the art encoding format), HEVC offers about double the data compression ratio at the same level of video quality, or substantially improved video quality at the same bit rate.</description></item><item><title>How do I discard unstaged changes in Git?</title><link>https://singhkays.com/blog/git-discard-changes-terminal/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://singhkays.com/blog/git-discard-changes-terminal/</guid><description>Often when I’m working on this blog, I work over multiple days and end up working on multiple devices.
