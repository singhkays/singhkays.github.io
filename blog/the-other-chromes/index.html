  <div class="post-content">
<p>We’re living in a golden age of web browser choice. But before I begin
this story, I need to take you back to 2006. You see back in 2006 as a
young technologist, my choices of a web browser were limited. It was
either Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox. But then one day while
browsing through PC World magazine, I discovered an alternate option –
Opera.</p>
<p>Opera had <a href="https://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2006/05/10-features-youll-find-only-in-opera.html">many differentiated
features</a>
such as a customizable streamlined user interface as well as being <a href="https://www.garyshood.com/browser/">more
memory efficient</a> and <a href="http://lowendmac.com/2005/whats-the-fastest-mac-browser-across-platforms/">faster than
Firefox</a>.
There were many other features that made Opera my go-to browser but the
most important for my browsing on a 256 Kbps turned out to be the
“Instant-back”. Normally, when you press the back button in a browser,
it will try to reload the page but in Opera the page loaded from cache,
so the back action was instant!</p>
<h2 id="google-has-a-say">Google has a say<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#google-has-a-say">#</a></h2>
<p>In September 2008, everything changed when Google decided to enter the
browser market with Chrome. I remember downloading the first beta of
Chrome and thinking this is fantastic! What Chrome was lacking in
features, it made up in speed. Since then, Chrome has gained massive
popularity and become the most popular browser in the market. These
days, Chrome enjoys a position of dominance that Internet Explorer once
held. All new websites were developed to work with Internet Explorer,
something which developers do for Chrome today. Looking at the Google
trends chart over the last 15 years below will give you an idea of how
Chrome’s popularity has risen over time.</p>
<p><img src="images/google-trends.png" alt="google trends of mozilla firefox vs microsoft internet explorer vs google chrome in 2008"></p>
<h2 id="the-other-chromes">The &ldquo;Other Chromes&rdquo;<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-other-chromes">#</a></h2>
<p>Along with the release of Chrome, Google also provided majority of the
source code used to build Chrome in the form of Chromium project. Using
this source code, many other companies have been able to build alternate
browsers on the same stable and fast engine that powers Chrome. Free
from having to invest resources in building and maintaining a rendering
engine, these companies have been able to focus on adding features that
are missing from the Chromium source such as syncing of settings and
bookmarks as well as features that are sometimes not even available in
Chrome (e.g. Opera introduced video pop out 2 years before Chrome). And
because these browsers are built on a Chromium source, they are able to
access the extensions in the Chrome Web store as well.</p>
<p>I’m calling these browsers - <em>“The Other Chromes”</em>. This blog is a
summary of the budding alternate Chromium based browser market and how
these browsers are vying to take market share away from Chrome with
their unique features. These browsers have been increasing in number as
well as popularity. Part of the charm of these browsers is that they
allow privacy focused users to step outside of Google’s ecosystem
without compromising on performance.</p>

<p>Before adopting Chromium projects WebKit engine and later Blink engine
in 2013, Opera developed its own Presto engine. With the move to the
Chromium source, Opera lost many of its distinctive features such as
integrated Opera mail. Since then, Opera has been busy differentiating
itself from Chrome with its unique features. Here are some of the
standout features:</p>
<p><strong>1. Video Picture-in-Picture (PiP)</strong> – I find this the most impressive
feature of Opera. <a href="https://blogs.opera.com/desktop/2016/04/opera-beta-update-video-pop/">Video PiP was introduced in
April 2016</a>,
which is a full two years before <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/10/watch-video-using-picture-in-picture">Chrome got the same
feature</a>.
Still, I find Opera’s picture-in-picture more useful. Currently,
Chrome’s PiP requires two right clicks to activate compared to Opera
which has a dedicated floating button on the video to activate PiP.
Opera’s PiP is also a lot more useful as it shows video controls
such as the video name, button for skipping to next video, volume
control and video time indicator. You can even click the video name
in the PiP window to be taken back to the tab in the browser!
Chrome has a barebones floating window with just pause/resume
capability. Here are some screenshots to compare the two (Opera on
left, Chrome on right):
<img src="images/Opera-Chrome-Pop-out-comparison.png" alt="">
<img src="images/pop-out-overlay.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>2. Integrated adblocker</strong> – Opera was also the <a href="https://blogs.opera.com/desktop/2016/03/native-ad-blocking-feature-opera-for-computers/">first browser to
integrate an
adblocker</a>
in 2016. Chrome recently introduced this functionality in 2018 but
it only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/14/how-chromes-built-in-ad-blocker-will-work-when-it-goes-live-tomorrow/">blocks a subset of ads which don’t conform to the Coalition
for Better Ads
guidelines</a>.
It’s not surprising to see Chrome not blocking all kinds of ads
given Google’s ad-based business model.</p>
<p><strong>3. Built-in VPN</strong> – In 2016, <a href="https://blogs.opera.com/desktop/2016/04/free-vpn-integrated-opera-for-windows-mac/">Opera also added a free built in
VPN</a>
for enhanced privacy.</p>
<p><strong>4. Opera Turbo</strong> – <a href="https://www.opera.com/turbo">Turbo is one of the oldest Opera
features</a> which helps with browsing on
slow connections. When this mode is turned on, all the traffic
passes through Opera’s servers where it’s compressed, and your
device receives a fraction of the original size of the content.</p>
<p><strong>5. Other notable features included in Opera are</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.opera.com/computer/features/battery-saver">Battery Saver</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.opera.com/computer/features/news-reader">News reader</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.opera.com/computer/features/units-converter">Currency, Unit &amp; Time Zone converters</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For full list of features see <a href="https://www.opera.com/computer/features">https://www.opera.com/computer/features</a></p>
<p>In addition to the above features, Opera has also launched a new concept browser dubbed - &ldquo;Opera Neon&rdquo; which reimagines the way we browse the web. Here&rsquo;s a short video</p>

<p>Vivaldi is a recent entrant that was founded by Opera co-founder and
former Opera CEO. Vivaldi is intended for the users who were disgruntled
by Opera’s switch from Presto layout engine and loss of many loved
features. Vivaldi offers an insane level of customization for its
user-interface! The default UI uses the dominant color on the website
for its accent color which makes the browser UI look like an extension
of the webpage. Here are few examples</p>
<p><img src="images/Vivaldi-ui-1.png" alt="Vivaldi browser adaptable UI">
<img src="images/Vivaldi-ui-3.png" alt="Vivaldi browser adaptable UI">
<img src="images/apperance.jpg" alt="Vivaldi browser adaptable UI">
<img src="images/adaptive-colors-v3.gif" alt="Vivaldi browser adaptable UI"></p>
<p>Vivaldi has tons of other customization features which can be viewed
here <a href="https://vivaldi.com/features/">https://vivaldi.com/features/</a>. Here are some of my favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tab stacking allows grouping of tabs</li>
<li>Tabs can be viewed in split screen in the same browser window</li>
<li>Built in tab hibernation support</li>
<li>Ability to customize the browser theme to your liking</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="brave">Brave<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#brave">#</a></h3>
<p><img src="images/Brave.png" alt="Brave browser UI"></p>
<p>Brave is the most recent entrant in the built-from Chromium browser
space and one which has the most unique take. By default, Brave comes
with Brave shield, which blocks tracking cookies and ads. Brave shield
will also upgrade your connection to HTTPS whenever possible. Here’s
what Brave shield looks like:</p>
<p><img src="images/shield.png" alt="Brave browser shield"></p>
<p>Blocking ads by default sets up a dangerous precedent for the health of
the web as many of your favorite sites depend on ad-revenue. However,
Brave offers an elegant solution for the publishers as well as the
users.</p>
<p>In the first phase launches which launches soon, users can opt-in to
view the ads and receive up to 70% of the gross ad revenue.</p>
<p><img src="images/braveRewardsOptin.gif" alt="Brave browser rewards opt in"></p>
<p>Since Brave is built with privacy in mind, users get a notification to view an ad at
a time that the browser finds appropriate and not disruptive.</p>
<p><img src="images/adExample01.png" alt="Brave browser rewards ads">
<img src="images/adExample02.png" alt="Brave browser rewards ads"></p>
<p>When users
click to engage with these notifications, they’re presented with a
full-page ad in a private ad tab. Brave Ads are opt-in, and do not
replace ads on websites.</p>
<p><img src="images/adDemoHooch.png" alt="Brave browser ads"></p>
<p>The second phase of Brave’s ad system will
launch later this year. In the second phase, Brave will partner with
publishers to replace ads in the websites users visit. In this model,
the publishers will get 70%, users will get 15% and Brave will get 15%
of the ad revenue. More on this can be found in this <a href="https://brave.com/brave-previews-opt-in-ads-in-desktop-browser-developer-channel/">blog post</a></p>
<p>Brave’s ad-system will be a tough sell for both users, who are used to
blocking ads with various ad-blockers and publishers who will have to
sign up for a different system for serving ads. It will be interesting
to see if this model will end up being successful and if it changes the
way we browse the web.</p>
<h3 id="microsoft-edge">Microsoft Edge<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#microsoft-edge">#</a></h3>
<p>The most recent and shocking announcement in the browser space has been
Microsoft’s decision to stop development on its own EdgeHTML rendering
engine and Chakra javascript engine and re-build Edge based on Chromium
source. Given Chrome’s dominance in the browser market and Edge’s
failure to gain significant traction, it is understandable why Microsoft
made this decision. This leaves Mozilla Firefox as the only other
mainstream browser that implements its own rendering engine. What this
means for web standards and website compatibility is yet to be seen as
developers might choose to optimize their websites for Chromium based
browsers only.</p>
<h3 id="mobile">Mobile<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#mobile">#</a></h3>
<p>On smartphones and mobile devices, you’ll find even more browsers that
are built from Chromium source. Here are just some of the most popular
ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Samsung Internet Browser</li>
<li>Amazon Silk Browser</li>
<li>Kiwi Browser</li>
<li>Bromite</li>
<li>Ecosia</li>
<li>Brave</li>
<li>Opera</li>
</ul>
<p>Although many of these browsers might look like Chrome, they offer
additional capabilities like native ad-blocking capability <em>(Brave,
Kiwi, Bromite)</em>, night mode <em>(Kiwi)</em>, ability to move navigation bar to
bottom <em>(Kiwi)</em> or the ability to play Youtube videos in the background
<em>(Kiwi,
Bromite)</em>.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#looking-forward">#</a></h2>
<p>2019 is going to be an interesting year for Brave &amp; Vivaldi. For Brave, it will be the first true test of it&rsquo;s new ad system. For Vivaldi, which is much further along and more feature complete it will be interesting to see if it can attract long time Chrome users. For Opera, I expect to see more unique features as well as keeping an eye out to see if they go anywhere with their Neon concept.</p>
