It‚Äôs no fault of our MacBook‚Äôs though - this is the tradeoff we make for portability.\nThe problem starts when we start hooking up an external monitor to match the clarity and DPI of the MacBook‚Äôs retina screen i.e., a 4K or 5K monitor. 4K monitors have only recently become mainstream. Now, the external display can be on par with the retina screens' crispness and clarity. This, though, is the root of the problem. The refresh rate on the MacBook retina displays is 60 Hz, which means the screen updates with new images 60 times each second. A higher refresh rate results in a smoother picture, which is why an iPad Pro screen that refreshes at 120 Hz is smoother to use. To run a 4K monitor at 60 Hz requires the right combination of hardware, cables, and adapters.\nHere are two kinds of problems you might encounter:\n MacBook does not allow you to select a 4K resolution when connected to a 4K monitor MacBook only runs the 4K resolution at 30 Hz aka animations and mouse movement is choppy  To figure out a solution, here‚Äôs what I recommend.\nStep 1: Check if your MacBook supports 4K resolution The first step is to make sure your MacBook supports outputting 4K signal to an external monitor. The best place to check is on Apple‚Äôs Support website. A search query like the following will usually bring up the correct model.\n apple macbook 13 inch 2016 technical specifications\n NOTE: You‚Äôll need to specify the year and screen size (13, 15, 16 inches etc.) to match your machine.\nThen the supported resolution‚Äôs are usually specified in the ‚ÄúVideo Support‚Äù section. Here are two examples of the 2016 models.\nMacBook 2016\n Graphics and Video Support Intel HD Graphics 515 Dual display and video mirroring: simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 3840 by 2160 pixels at 30Hz on an external display, both at millions of colors\n MacBook Pro 2016\n Video Support Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display at millions of colors and: One display with 5120-by-2880 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors Up to two displays with 4096-by-2304 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors\n Notice the difference above in the bolded text. Both these 2016 models support 4K resolution (3840 by 2160 pixels or higher), but the 2016 MacBook only supports running an external display at 30 Hz. So, this is the first order of business to tackle and find out if your machine can support 4K external display and, more importantly, at 60 Hz.\nStep 2: Make sure you‚Äôve got the right adapter In recent MacBook models, Apple has removed the full HDMI ports and replaced them with USB-C Thunderbolt ports that perform video-out duties. This is great if you want to reduce the number of cables because the USB-C cable can also charge the MacBook. Still, the majority of users have legacy type connections i.e. HDMI or Display Port cables. Apple sells a USB-C adapter that lets you plug in an HDMI cable. There are actually two Apple USB-C adapters, and this is where Apple makes it more challenging than it needs to be. Both these adapters look exactly the same as the below image, but only one supports 4K 60Hz.\n Model¬†A2119 is the newest model that supports HDMI 2.0 and up to 4K 60 Hz.

<p>With many of us knowledge workers working from home in the COVID-19 era, our trusty Apple MacBook&rsquo;s retina displays often need a bigger friend to take over the display duties. It&rsquo;s no fault of our MacBook&rsquo;s though - this is the tradeoff we make for portability.</p>
<p>The problem starts when we start hooking up an external monitor to match the clarity and DPI of the MacBook&rsquo;s retina screen i.e., a 4K or 5K monitor. 4K monitors have only recently become mainstream. Now, the external display can be on par with the retina screens' crispness and clarity. This, though, is the root of the problem. The refresh rate on the MacBook retina displays is 60 Hz, which means the screen updates with new images 60 times each second. A higher refresh rate results in a smoother picture, which is why an iPad Pro screen that refreshes at 120 Hz is smoother to use. To run a 4K monitor at 60 Hz requires the right combination of hardware, cables, and adapters.</p>
<p>Here are two kinds of problems you might encounter:</p>
<ol>
<li>MacBook does not allow you to select a 4K resolution when connected to a 4K monitor</li>
<li>MacBook only runs the 4K resolution at 30 Hz aka animations and mouse movement is choppy</li>
</ol>
<p>To figure out a solution, here&rsquo;s what I recommend.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="step-1-check-if-your-macbook-supports-4k-resolution">Step 1: Check if your MacBook supports 4K resolution<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-1-check-if-your-macbook-supports-4k-resolution">#</a></h2>
<p>The first step is to make sure your MacBook supports outputting 4K signal to an external monitor. The best place to check is on <a href="https://support.apple.com">Apple‚Äôs Support website</a>. A search query like the following will usually bring up the correct model.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>apple macbook 13 inch 2016 technical specifications</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>NOTE: You‚Äôll need to specify the year  and screen size (13, 15, 16 inches etc.) to match your machine.</em></p>
<p>Then the supported resolution‚Äôs are usually specified in the ‚ÄúVideo Support‚Äù section. Here are two examples of the 2016 models.</p>
<p><strong>MacBook 2016</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Graphics and Video Support
Intel HD Graphics 515
Dual display and video mirroring: simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to <strong>3840 by 2160 pixels at 30Hz</strong> on an external display, both at millions of colors</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MacBook Pro 2016</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Video Support
Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display at millions of colors and:
One display with <strong>5120-by-2880 resolution at 60Hz</strong> at over a billion colors
Up to two displays with <strong>4096-by-2304 resolution at 60Hz</strong> at over a billion colors</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the difference above in the bolded text. Both these 2016 models support 4K resolution (<em>3840 by 2160 pixels or higher</em>), but the 2016 MacBook only supports running an external display at 30 Hz. So, this is the first order of business to tackle and find out if your machine can support 4K external display and, more importantly, at 60 Hz.</p>

<p>In recent MacBook models, Apple has removed the full HDMI ports and replaced them with USB-C Thunderbolt ports that perform video-out duties. This is great if you want to reduce the number of cables because the USB-C cable can also charge the MacBook. Still, the majority of users have legacy type connections i.e. HDMI or Display Port cables. Apple sells a USB-C adapter that lets you plug in an HDMI cable. There are actually two Apple USB-C adapters, and this is where Apple makes it more challenging than it needs to be. Both these adapters look exactly the same as the below image, but only one supports 4K 60Hz.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Model¬†A2119</strong> is the newest model that supports HDMI 2.0 and up to <strong>4K 60 Hz</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Model A1621</strong>¬†supports HDMI 1.4b and <strong>4K up to 30 Hz</strong>.</li>
</ol>
