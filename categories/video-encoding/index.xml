      <description>January is usually a big month for tech because the Consumer Electronics Shows kicks off every year in Las Vegas. This year was no different as various manufacturers brought their latest products to showcase.
Samsung and LG 2020 TVs to support AV1 decoding We have been waiting all of 2019 to see consumer devices that can decode AV1 and CES did not disappoint! Both Samsung and LG announced their upcoming 2020 TVs will be capable of full hardware decode of 8K AV1 videos from sources such as YouTube.</description>

      <title>AV1 2019: A Year In Review</title>

      <description>Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s not often you see so many logos of tech giants on one page backing the same technology. In my experience, every enterprise has developed a case of NIH and come up with their standards. No surprise then that there&amp;rsquo;s an XKCD describing this phenomenon!
But when the AV1 1.0.0 spec was finalized in 2018, with the backing of so many giants, the world knew AV1 would be a serious piece of tech.</description>

      <description>The Tale of Two next-gen SOCs - Snapdragon 865 and MediaTek Dimensity 1000 Last month, we saw the release of SOCs expected to power next-gen flagship smartphones. Since the AV1 standard as formalized, the community has been waiting to see when SOC manufacturers add hardware support for AV1 decoding. It looks like we&#39;ll be waiting a lot longer for such a chip from Qualcomm. In what might come as a shock, MediaTek announced the first SOC to feature such support with their new Dimensity 1000 chip.</description>

      <description>This is a 3-part blog covering how to build a scalable shot-based serverless video encoder in Azure. In Part 1, I explain what AV1 is and where we are in the video encoding space. In part 2, we create a logic app to upload and index the video. In part 3, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to split the video into its scenes and encode individual scenes. For reference, here are the links to all the parts:</description>

      <title>Now Available: Weekly build of libaom AV1 &#43; FFmpeg docker image</title>

      <description>Motivation While trying to try out the latest features for the libaom AV1 encoder, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to figure out how to get a hold of the latest binary. As of writing of this blog, I haven&amp;rsquo;t come across any source on the web that publishes a binary of libaom AV1 encoder. Often while trying to get a hold of the latest changes in libaom, you have to build the source yourself which takes time.</description>

      <description>AVIF in Spectrum lib While browsing for AV1/AVIF updates, I noticed this commit to Facebook&amp;rsquo;s open source Spectrum library that adds support for AVIF format.
 https://github.com/facebookincubator/spectrum/commit/89b87bee831d3c7aabd0ad327fb118ce699df55d  Spectrum is an image transcoding library for iOS and Android that is meant to be integrated into apps for image operations. Hopefully this means that we&amp;rsquo;ll see apps supporting AVIF format soon!

      <description>If May and June were F1 race cars in terms of speed of AV1 development, then July would probably be a Honda Civic. After numerous exciting announcements in the previous month, July felt like everyone&amp;rsquo;s on vacation, which is probably true because summer months tend to be slow as the school&amp;rsquo;s out. So, this update will be a short one as I&amp;rsquo;m out on vacation as well :)

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a pretty busy for me professionally which is why this month&amp;rsquo;s AV1 ecosystem update is coming in pretty late. It&amp;rsquo;s been one of the most exciting months for AV1 development and a lot to catch up on! With so much news this month, it is starting to feel like we&amp;rsquo;re at the cusp of something big! (which we hope AV1 will be )
Youtube pauses AV1 rollout Currently, YouTube is the biggest streaming platform delivering AV1 video and is responsible for the majority of AV1 video consumption on the internet.</description>

      <description>May was another amazing month for the AV1 codec! We saw great progress in the SVT-AV1 encoder, Android update news and some surprising news out of China!
SVT-AV1 is making strides! Let&amp;rsquo;s start with SVT-AV1 encoder, the current encoder of choice for Netflix, being developed by the folks at Intel. In May, version 0.5.0 was released with the following features:
 8 bit / 10 bit 4:2:0 up to 4K60p resolutions Presets 0-8 New API, FFmpeg, GStreamer plugins Rate control support (VBR, CVBR) Block sizes from 4x4 to 128x128 Non-square blocks Tiles Deblocking / CDEF / Restoration filters Film Grain Warped motion estimation Intra block copy Trellis quantized coefficient optimization Support for 4 and 5 layers prediction structures Chroma search in MD Multi-reference picture support  Other notable updates   May also saw the most number of commits to the SVT-AV1 Github repo as shown by the graph below.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been an exciting time following the progress of the royalty free video codec AV1 over the past year and April might just be the most exciting active month in the amount of news we got about AV1! It&amp;rsquo;s not every day that media industry giants such as Netflix, Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, ARM, Facebook, Nvidia, Intel, Cisco and many others agree on the same technology stack!
Samsung joins the party The month started with Samsung announcing they were joining the Alliance of Open Media Board at the highest level.</description>

      <title>It&#39;s time to replace GIFs with AV1 video!</title>
      <link>https://singhkays.com/blog/its-time-replace-gifs-with-av1-video/</link>

      <guid>https://singhkays.com/blog/its-time-replace-gifs-with-av1-video/</guid>
      <description>It is 2019 and we need to make a decision about GIFs (no, not that one! We’re never going to be able to decide that one!). GIFs take up a massive amount of space (often multiple megabytes!) and if you’re a web developer, then that’s completely against your ethos! As a web developer, you want to minimize the bits your users need to download so that your website loads fast. That’s why you minify javascript, optimize PNGs, JPEGs and sometimes turn JPEGs to WebPs as well.</description>

      <title>Testing x265 encoder scaling on a 128 core Azure VM for 4K HDR</title>

      <description>Video encoding has always been a fairly compute intensive task. With every new generation of video encoders, more computational power has been required to achieve the compression benefits. HEVC/H.265 is the latest state of the art video compression standard with x265 being the most popular open-source encoder used for encoding into the HEVC/H.265 format. In comparison to AVC/H.264 (the previous state of the art encoding format), HEVC offers about double the data compression ratio at the same level of video quality, or substantially improved video quality at the same bit rate.</description>
