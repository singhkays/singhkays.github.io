      <description>I ran into a very weird error today. While trying to automate the deployment for this blog, I needed to replace a string in a file. The internet tutorials [1, 2, 3, 4] told me that sed would be perfect for this job and the following command should work:
sed -i &amp;#39;s/search_string/replace_string/&amp;#39; filename The Error However, I kept getting tripped up by the following error:
sed: 1: &amp;#34;i2.html&amp;#34;: command i expects \ followed by text I spent a bunch of time trying to make sure I escaped the right characters in my strings but the error was persistent!</description>
