      <description>In Azure, every VM has a persistent OS Disk that is used for booting the VM and contains the operating system. In addition to an OS disk, each VM also has a temporary disk that is present on the compute cluster hosting your VM.
Why is my OS disk not @ /dev/sda? In most cases the OS disk is /dev/sda but in some odd cases it is not. This is not an Azure specific issue but a default Linux behavior.</description>

      <description>Azure Resource Manager stack has been released for almost three years now. In those three years many features have been added that are exclusive to Azure Resource Manager. In this session, I demonstrate the process of migrating your existing infrastructure to Azure Resource Manager without downtime. See a list of all the benefits here: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/migrate-iaas-to-azure-resource-manager.

      <title>Vertical Scale Runbooks Updated with the latest Azure VM Sizes</title>

      <description>In the world of cloud, horizontal scaling is well understood these days. It is easy to use applications like Kubernetes to automate the scale out your containerized applications based on workload demand. For applications running on VMs, we have cloud native services like VM Scale Sets that make scaling in and out a breeze. However, for an on-prem application going through a lift &amp;amp; shift to the cloud, vertical scaling of the VM is still the king.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Azure B Series and CPU credits</title>

      <description>Azure recently introduced its first burstable VM size - the B-series. This VM type is meant to compete directly with AWS&#39; T2 instances. In the below few words (or more :smile: ) I try to explain what this means and why you should care. If you still have questions after reading, hit me up on Twitter or leave a comment below.
So why do I need a burstable size anyway? If you have applications that remain idle for a long time and burst occasionally, then the B-series might be the perfect fit for you.</description>
